# Machine-Learning-with-the-Titanic-Dataset
Project Summary:
In this project, I worked with the Titanic dataset, a CSV file containing information about passengers on the Titanic. Through data exploration, analysis, and visualization, I gained insights and generated tables and charts to understand various aspects of the dataset.

Furthermore, I applied machine learning techniques to predict the survival of Titanic passengers. I experimented with three different models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbor. By training these models on the dataset, I aimed to develop accurate predictions for whether a passenger survived or not based on their available features.

This project showcases my ability to work with real-world datasets, perform data analysis, create visualizations, and implement machine learning algorithms for predictive tasks.
